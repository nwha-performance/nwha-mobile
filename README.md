# About

['nothing to write home about'](https://www.nwha2.com) is a space for exploring everyday life and routine. Our aim is to
show that ordinary life,
which each of us tries to hide from outside eyes, can tell much more about a person than the public part we express.
Research your everyday world with one-photo tasks, answering questions, observing others' routine.
